Student Fee Reimbursement Prediction System | Machine Learning Project

Developed a machine learning–based prediction model to identify eligible students for government fee reimbursement programs with 96% accuracy.

Built a feature-weighted model incorporating socio-economic parameters (single parent, agricultural income, medical expenditure, etc.) to improve fairness and prediction reliability.

Implemented data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model weighting to handle imbalance and enhance decision impact.

Used Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and Logistic Regression/Random Forest for model training and evaluation.

Exported trained model and created an interactive prediction tool for real-time student eligibility assessment.

Deployed code to GitHub and maintained version control using Git.

Tech Stack: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Git, GitHub
